                <h2>Who I Am</h2>
                <p>
                    Hi! I’m Romeo Garcia Jr., an engineer passionate about robotics, automation, and building innovative solutions. 
                    I’m currently completing my master’s in Mechanical Engineering at Stanford, focusing on mechatronics and robotics.  Before this, I earned 
                    my BS in Mechanical Engineering with a concentration in product realization. 
                </p>   
                <p>
                    Recently I was a course assistant for ME 170, Stanford’s senior capstone design course, 
                    where I guided students through the process of turning ideas into impactful engineering solutions. Now, I’m the course assistant for ME 123, where I 
                    help students apply their fundamental engineering knowledge through computational methods.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Along the way, I’ve had the chance to work on some amazing projects, 
                    like spending two summers at a startup figuring out how to respond to aerodynamic changes in real time for semi-trucks. I've also enjoyed mentoring middle and high school
                    students in the fundamentals of engineering, design, CAD, and coding the past couple of years. 
                </p> 
                <p>  
                    I love tackling tough problems, 
                    working with others on creative projects, and bringing ideas to life. I’m especially interested in how robotics and consumer electronics intersect to 
                    shape our everyday experiences—from autonomous home devices to humanoid robots. 
                </p>

        <!-- What I Do Section -->
        <div class="about-section">
            <h2>What I Do</h2>
            <p>
                I design and build innovative robotic and embedded systems, focusing on practical, real-world solutions. My experience spans multiple fabrication techniques, 
                including CNC machining, lathe work, milling, silversmithing, laser cutting, and 3D printing. 
            </p>
            <p>
                These hands-on skills allow me to take ideas from concept to reality, ensuring precision and functionality in every project.
            </p>
               
            <p>
                With a few robotics projects under my belt, I’ve developed systems like robotic arms and control mechanisms, balancing creative problem-solving with technical expertise. 
                I enjoy combining mechanical design with programming to create systems that are reliable, efficient, and purpose-driven.
                Whether it’s programming microcontrollers, fabricating custom parts, or assembling complex systems, I’m passionate about engineering solutions that work and evolve. My work 
                reflects a commitment to mastering the tools and technologies that bring ideas to life, one project at a time.   
            </p>

        <!-- What I Aspire To Do Section -->
        <div class="about-section">
            <h2>Mission</h2>
            <p>
                I’m dedicated to integrating robotics, mechatronics, and thoughtful design to address real-world challenges and uplift communities. Whether it’s creating 
                sustainable solutions, refining autonomous systems, developing innovative products, or advancing engineering possibilities, I aim to do 
                my part in making a positive impact on the world</p>
