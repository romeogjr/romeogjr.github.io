                <h2> Autonomous Crate Transport Robot </h2>
                <p>Frank’s design prioritizes simplicity: a single-degree-of-freedom 4-bar lift, a magnet-and-pusher grabber, and automatic line-follower calibration minimize complexity. 
                    By focusing solely on scoring on his own STACKs, he consistently accrued points and claimed second place in the final tournament.</p>

                        Through this project, I’ve learned to optimize designs using generative tools, integrate servo motors with a Raspberry Pi,
                            and use computer vision for object detection and positioning. I’ve also gained experience applying inverse kinematics for
                            precise movement, developing software for automation, and ensuring everything fits together seamlessly. Additionally, I’ve
                            improved my problem-solving skills by tackling challenges across mechanical, electrical, and software aspects of the project.

                        and minimizing setup complexity. Through CNC machining, I developed skills in achieving tight tolerances and assembling components with 
                        carefully designed mechanical interfaces for smooth operation.</p>

                        <h2>Automated Wire Rope Lubrication</h2>
                        <p>Designed and developed an automated lubrication system for Renewell Energy’s Gravity Well, which repurposes inactive oil wells 
                            into clean energy storage systems. The system reduces operational costs by extending the lifespan of a key component—the wire 
                            rope—through effective lubrication. It integrates a water pump, air compressor, atomizing nozzle, and environmentally friendly 
                            lubricant to deliver precise, efficient coverage at 60 ft/min. The project involved determining optimal pressure settings, performing 
                            static tests, and creating a scalable, autonomous solution to minimize human intervention and power consumption.</p>

                    <h3>What I Learned</h3>
                    <p>I developed skills in conducting detailed testing, performing Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) to identify and mitigate 
                        design risks, and delivering effective design reviews. Additionally, I gained experience translating User Requirements (UR) into actionable 
                        Engineering Requirements (ER), ensuring the system met performance, environmental, and energy constraints. Collaborating with multidisciplinary 
                        teams and maintaining thorough documentation helped me address real-world challenges in sustainable and cost-effective engineering solutions.</p>
